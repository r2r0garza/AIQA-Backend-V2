    2. for relational data:
        - Create separate tables for each entity
        - Clearly label each table
        - Include header rows with exact column names from source
        - Ensure referential integrity between tables
        - Maintain primary and foreign key relationships

    3. For time series data:
        - Present chronologically
        - Include date/time column as first column
        - Maintain temporal patterns and seasonality
